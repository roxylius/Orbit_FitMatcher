# Orbit AI - Right Fit Matcher

This is my submission for the Orbit AI Full-Stack Developer Assessment. I chose the Right Fit Matcher product because it tackles a genuine pain point in university admissionsâ€”helping students navigate the uncertainty with clear, data-backed insights that feel more approachable than generic search tools. The goal was to build a full-stack application that helps students find universities that are the right fit for them based on their academic profile.

The project aims to solve a real problem: This tool provides data-driven recommendations to help them find "Safety," "Target," and "Reach" schools, making the process a bit more transparent and less of a black box along with reasons for each choice. By focusing on personalized match scores and explanations, it goes beyond basic listings to build user confidence in their applications.

## The Matching Algorithm Explained

The heart of this project is the matching algorithm. I wanted to make it more than just a simple filter; it needed to give a realistic sense of admission probability. Here's a breakdown of how it works, based on the logic from the product doc, but refined for better accuracy and user feedback.

### How it Works

The algorithm calculates a "Match Score" for each university based on the user's profile. This isn't an exact science, of course, but it's a weighted calculation to give a good estimate. The factors and their weights are:

*   **GMAT/GRE Score:** 40%
*   **GPA:** 30%
*   **Work Experience:** 20%
*   **University Acceptance Rate:** 10% (as a modifier)

Each factor is scored individually, and then a weighted average is calculated to get the final `match_percentage`. I tweaked the scoring to include nuanced comparisons, like "close to" thresholds, for more precise categorization.

### Match Categories

Based on the final score, universities are grouped into three categories to help students build a balanced application strategy:

*   **Safety (70-100%):** Your profile is well above the university's average. You have a strong chance of getting in.
*   **Target (50-69%):** Your profile is a good fit for the university's average admitted student. These are your core schools.
*   **Reach (Below 50%):** Your profile is below the university's average. It's a long shot, but not impossible, especially with standout essays and recommendations.

### "Why this match?" - The Reasoning

To make the results transparent, the app provides specific reasons for each match. This was a key part of the product vision, and I enhanced it with tailored advice sentences that tie back to the user's strengths. The logic is:

*   **For GMAT/GRE:** It compares your score to the university's median. It will tell you if your score "significantly exceeds," "meets," is "close to," or is "below" the median. This helps you see where you stand on the most important metric.
*   **For GPA:** Similar to the GMAT, it checks if your GPA is "well above," "meets," or is "below" the median, giving you a clear picture of your academic standing.
*   **For Work Experience:** It checks if your years of experience "align with," "exceed," or are "below" the average for that program. This is especially important for MBA programs.
*   **Final Advice:** It gives a concluding sentence based on the match category, like "This is a strong safety school for your profile" or "This is a reach school. Consider applying if it's your dream program, but have backup options."

The idea was to avoid a "black box" and give users actionable feedback they can use to either feel confident about their chances or identify areas they need to strengthen in their application. These additions make the tool more empowering, turning vague odds into practical next steps.

## Features Implemented

I managed to implement most of the core and some of the enhanced features outlined in the product doc, including backend caching for faster responses and basic testing to ensure reliability.

*   **Full-Stack TypeScript:** Both the frontend and backend are built with TypeScript for better type safety.
*   **User Authentication & Reset Pass:** Users can sign up, log in, and have their sessions managed. This is needed for saving universities.
*   **Fit Matching Algorithm:** The core of the app. It takes a user's profile (GMAT/GRE, GPA, work experience) and calculates a match score for a list of universities.
*   **University Search & Filtering:** You can search for universities and filter them by program type, location, etc.
*   **Save Universities:** Logged-in users can save a list of their favorite universities.
*   **Backend Caching:** Implemented a basic caching layer on the backend to speed up frequent requests and reduce database load.
*   **Normalized PostgreSQL DB:** The database schema is normalized to avoid data redundancy.
*   **React Context API:** Used for state management on the frontend to avoid prop drilling.
*   **Basic Testing using Just:** Use jest to create basic unit test cases to test app logic
*   **Session Persistence:** Used passport.js and express-sessions to create persistant session for the user

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Package Manager:** Bun

## Getting Started

To get this running on your local machine, you'll need Node.js, Bun, and a running PostgreSQL instance.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   Bun (v1.0 or higher)
*   PostgreSQL

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Set up your PostgreSQL database

#    - Run the schema.sql file to create the tables
psql -U your_postgres_user -d orbit_matcher -f db/schema.sql

#    - Seed the database with sample data
psql -U your_postgres_user -d orbit_matcher -f db/seed/seedData.sql

# 4. Set up environment variables
.env.example 

# 5. Start the server
bun run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Set up environment variables
.env.example

# 4. Start the client
bun run dev
```

## API Endpoints

Here are the main endpoints I created for the application.

*   `POST /api/auth/signup` - Register a new user.
*   `POST /api/auth/login` - Log a user in.
*   `POST /api/match` - Takes a user's profile data and returns a list of university matches.
*   `GET /api/universities` - Gets a list of all universities, with optional query params for filtering.
*   `POST /api/auth/saved-universities` - Saves a university to the logged-in user's profile.
*   `GET /api/auth/saved-universities` - Retrieves the saved universities for the logged-in user.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, here's what I'd add:

*   **More Robust Algorithm:** The current algorithm is a good start, but I'd love to incorporate more factors and maybe even use some machine learning to refine the weights based on real admission outcomes.
*   **Profile Strength Analysis:** A dashboard for users to see where their profile is strong or weak compared to their target schools.
*   **More Unit and Integration Tests:** I focused on getting the features working, but adding proper integrated testing to ensure the algorithm and endpoints are reliable.
*   **Export Data:** Export data in respective formats
