# Authentication Integration Summary

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (Oct 30, 2025)

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Hardcoded localhost URLs** → Now uses `API_BASE_URL` from config (respects `.env` file)
2. **Wrong user object parsing** → Updated to match backend response format:
   - Login returns: `{ message, user }`
   - Signup returns: `{ message, userObj }`
3. **Incorrect user ID field** → Changed from `user.id` to `user._id` (MongoDB ObjectId)
4. **Non-existent `/api/auth/me` endpoint** → Removed auto-check (backend doesn't have this endpoint)
5. **Missing console logs** → Added debug logging for all auth operations

### API Endpoints Now Being Called:
✅ `POST ${API_BASE_URL}/auth/signup` - User registration  
✅ `POST ${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login` - User authentication  
✅ `DELETE ${API_BASE_URL}/auth/logout` - Session destruction  
✅ `POST ${API_BASE_URL}/auth/forgot-password` - OTP generation  
✅ `POST ${API_BASE_URL}/auth/reset-password` - Password reset with OTP  

All endpoints now:
- Use environment variable from `.env` (supports ngrok, localhost, production URLs)
- Include `credentials: 'include'` for session cookies
- Have proper error handling with backend message extraction
- Log operations to browser console for debugging

## Overview
Successfully integrated session-based authentication into the University Matcher frontend application.

## Files Created

### 1. Authentication Hook
**File:** `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
- Created AuthProvider context with user state management
- Implements login, signup, logout functions
- Auto-checks auth status on mount via `/api/auth/me`
- All API calls include `credentials: 'include'` for session cookies

### 2. Protected Route Component
**File:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Guards dashboard routes from unauthorized access
- Shows loading spinner during auth check
- Redirects to `/login` if user not authenticated

### 3. Auth Pages (with shadcn/ui styling)

**File:** `src/pages/Login.tsx`
- Email/password login form
- Inline validation (email format, 6+ char password)
- Success message display for password reset
- Link to forgot password and signup

**File:** `src/pages/Signup.tsx`
- Registration form with name, email, password, confirm password
- Inline validation with error messages
- Password match validation
- Link to login page

**File:** `src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx`
- Email input for password reset
- Sends 6-digit OTP via backend API
- Success screen with instructions
- Links to reset password and login

**File:** `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx`
- OTP input (6-digit numeric, 100000-999999)
- New password input with confirmation
- 10-minute expiration notice
- Redirects to login on success

## Files Modified

### 1. App.tsx
- Wrapped entire app with `<AuthProvider>`
- Added public routes (login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password)
- Wrapped dashboard routes with `<ProtectedRoute>`
- Route structure:
  ```
  - /login (public)
  - /signup (public)
  - /forgot-password (public)
  - /reset-password (public)
  - / (protected)
    - /search
    - /fit-matcher
  ```

### 2. Sidebar.tsx
- Added useAuth hook integration
- Added user profile display (name, email, avatar)
- Added logout button with handler
- User info shown at bottom of sidebar

### 3. FitMatcher.tsx & Search.tsx
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch calls
- Ensures session cookies sent with API requests

## Authentication Flow

### Login Flow
1. User enters email/password
2. POST `/api/auth/login` with credentials
3. Backend sets `connect.sid` cookie (httpOnly, 180-day expiration)
4. User object stored in context
5. Redirect to `/search`

### Signup Flow
1. User enters name, email, password
2. Validation checks (email format, password length, password match)
3. POST `/api/auth/signup` with credentials
4. Backend creates user and sets session cookie
5. User object stored in context
6. Redirect to `/search`

### Password Reset Flow
1. User enters email on `/forgot-password`
2. POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`
3. Backend sends 6-digit OTP via email (expires in 10 min)
4. User enters OTP + new password on `/reset-password`
5. POST `/api/auth/reset-password` with OTP and new password
6. Success redirect to `/login` with success message

### Protected Routes
1. On mount, AuthProvider checks `/api/auth/me`
2. If authenticated, user object loaded
3. ProtectedRoute checks user state
4. If null, redirect to `/login`
5. If loading, show spinner
6. If authenticated, render protected content

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout button in sidebar
2. DELETE `/api/auth/logout` with credentials
3. Backend destroys session
4. Clear user from context
5. Redirect to `/login`

## Session Details
- Cookie name: `connect.sid`
- HttpOnly: Yes (prevents XSS attacks)
- Expiration: 180 days
- Auto-extends on each API call
- Credentials required: All fetch calls must include `credentials: 'include'`

## Validation Rules
- Email: Must be valid format (regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`)
- Password: Minimum 6 characters
- OTP: Exactly 6 digits (100000-999999)
- All fields required

## UI/UX Features
- Gradient theme: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100`
- Loading states with spinner animations
- Inline error messages (red border, red background)
- Success messages (green border, green background)
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Card-based layouts with shadcn/ui components
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Can sign up new user
- [ ] Can log in with existing user
- [ ] Protected routes redirect when not logged in
- [ ] Logout clears session
- [ ] Forgot password sends OTP email
- [ ] Reset password with valid OTP works
- [ ] Reset password with expired OTP fails
- [ ] Reset password with invalid OTP fails
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Session expires after 180 days
- [ ] All API calls include credentials

## Next Steps
1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Test signup flow at `http://localhost:5173/signup`
4. Test login flow at `http://localhost:5173/login`
5. Verify protected routes redirect properly
6. Test forgot password flow with email provider
7. Test session persistence (refresh page)

## Notes
- Backend must be running at `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend must have auth endpoints implemented
- Email service must be configured for OTP delivery
- CORS must allow credentials from frontend origin
