# Backend Project

This is a Node.js TypeScript backend project.

## Project Structure

```
backend
├── src
│   ├── app.ts          # Entry point of the application
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts    # Type definitions for the application
├── package.json         # npm configuration file
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration file
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Compile the TypeScript files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- The application is structured to separate concerns, with the main application logic in `src/app.ts` and type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`.
- Modify the `src/app.ts` file to add routes and middleware as needed.
- Use the `src/types/index.ts` file to define and export any interfaces or types that will be used throughout the application for better type safety.
